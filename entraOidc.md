# Setting up Microsoft Entra ID as an OIDC OP for WebSphere Application Server and Liberty clients
---

[Microsoft :registered: Azure:tm: Active Directory is now Microsoft Entra:tm: ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id).  The steps to set up an OIDC OP in Entra ID are almost the same as for Azure AD.  

The steps in [Setting up Azure as an OIDC OP for WebSphere Application Server and Liberty clients](https://github.com/WASdev/azure.sso.setup/blob/main/azureOidc.md) on this site have been modified to account for using the Azure portal or Entra ID admin center.  For steps to set up Entra ID as an OIDC OP, see [Setting up Azure as an OIDC OP for WebSphere Application Server and Liberty clients](https://github.com/WASdev/azure.sso.setup/blob/main/azureOidc.md).
